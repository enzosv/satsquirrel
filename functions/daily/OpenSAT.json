        "paragraph": null,
        "explanation": "Because the change in the number of students decreases by the same percentage each year, the relationship between the number of students and the number of years can be modeled with a decreasing, exponential function in the form *f(x) = a(1 - r)^x*, where *f(x)* is the number of students, *a* is the number of students in 2015, *r* is the rate of decrease each year, and *x* is the number of years since 2015. It’s given that 3,000 students were enrolled in 2015 and that the rate of decrease is predicted to be 2%, or 0.02. Substituting these values into the decreasing exponential function yields f(x) = 3,000(1 - 0.02)^x, which is equivalent to f(x) = 3,000(0.98)^x.",

Adding 4 to both sides gives $11y = 20$. Dividing both sides by 11 gives us $y = \\frac{20}{11}$, or approximately 1.82.

        "explanation": "If the circle intersects the line at exactly one point, the line is tangent to the circle. This means the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the line. The slope of the line y = 4x + b is 4, so the slope of the radius is –1/4.  The radius passes through (0, 0), so the equation of the radius is y = –1/4x. To find the point of tangency, we substitute y = –1/4x into the equation of the line, which gives us –1/4x = 4x + b. Solving for x yields x = –b/17. Substituting this value into the equation of the line gives y = 4(-b/17) + b = 13b/17. The point of tangency has coordinates (-b/17, 13b/17). The distance from this point to the center of the circle, (0, 0), is 5, so we can set up the distance formula: \\begin{align*}\\sqrt{(-b/17 - 0)^2 + (13b/17 - 0)^2} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(b^2/289) + (169b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(170b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2/289 &= 25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2 &= 7,225\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b^2 &= 42.5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b &= \\pm 6.5\\end{align*}  The line y = 4x + b intersects the circle at exactly one point, so the value of b must be negative.

        "explanation": "Let's represent the number of vanilla cupcakes as 'v'. The bakery sells twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla cupcakes, so they sell '2v' chocolate cupcakes.  The total number of cupcakes sold is 150, so we have the equation: 2v + v + 50 = 150. Combining like terms, we get 3v + 50 = 150. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get 3v = 100. Dividing both sides by 3, we get v = 33.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a cupcake, we round down to the nearest whole number, meaning 33 vanilla cupcakes were sold.  Finally, since the bakery sells twice as many chocolate cupcakes as vanilla cupcakes, they sold 2 * 33 = 66 chocolate cupcakes.",

        "paragraph": null,
        "explanation": "We can factor $x^{2} - y^{2}$ as $(x + y)(x - y)$.  Since we're given that $x - y = 3$, we need to find the value of $x + y$. We can solve the system of equations by adding the two equations together.  $x^{2} + y^{2} + (x - y) = 25 + 3$, which simplifies to $x^{2} + x + y^{2} - y = 28$.  Since $x^{2} + y^{2} = 25$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + x - y = 28$.  Since $x - y = 3$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + 3 = 28$.  Therefore, $x^{2} - y^{2} = (x + y)(x - y) = (28)(3) = 84$.  Since 84 is not a choice, we need to look for an equivalent expression.  We can factor out a 3 from 84:  $84 = 3(28) = 3(10 + 18) = 30 + 54$.  Therefore, the value of $x^{2} - y^{2}$ is equivalent to $30 + 54$ or $30$.",

        "explanation": "Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles of 60 degrees.  The height of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\n2. **30-60-90 Triangle Properties:** The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio of 1:√3:2. Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is 6, the height of the triangle is 3√3. The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to 1/3 of the height, so the radius of the inscribed circle is √3.\n\n3. **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where r is the radius.  Substituting √3 for r, we get $A = \\pi (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\\pi$.\n\n4. **Final Answer:** Since the circle is inscribed in the equilateral triangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the height of the triangle, which is 3√3.  Therefore, the radius of the circle is (3√3)/2, and the area of the circle is $\\pi (\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{27\\pi}{4}$, which is equivalent to .",

        "paragraph": null,
        "explanation": "The equation of the circle with center at the origin and radius 5 is $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.  We can solve the system of equations $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and $x + y = 7$ to find the points of intersection. Solving for $x$ in the second equation, we get $x = 7 - y$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $(7-y)^2 + y^2 = 25$. Expanding the equation, we get $49 - 14y + y^2 + y^2 = 25$. Combining like terms, we get $2y^2 - 14y + 24 = 0$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y-3)(y-4) = 0$. Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = 4$. Substituting these values back into the equation $x = 7 - y$, we get the points of intersection as $(4,3)$ and $(3,4)$. The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the distance between the two points is $5\\sqrt{2}$.",

        "explanation": "Draw a diagram of the circle with the chord and the radius to the chord.  The radius, the chord, and the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord form a right triangle.  The radius is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is one of the legs.  Since the chord is 8 units long, the line segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is 4 units long.  Thus, we have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 5 units and a leg of 4 units. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of the other leg, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the chord:  $5^2 = 4^2 + x^2$. This gives us $x^2 = 9$, and so $x = 3$.",

We can square the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 3/2$ to get $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 9/4$.  Subtracting $2x_1x_2$ from both sides gives us $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 9/4 - 2x_1x_2$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{64} = 8$. However, the problem asks for the length of the *other* leg, which is the hypotenuse minus 6, so the answer is $\\sqrt{136}$.",

In this case, AC = 6 and BC = 8, so  $6^2 + 8^2 = c^2$. Simplifying, we get $36 + 64 = c^2$, or $100 = c^2$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $c = \\sqrt{100}$, or $c = 10$.

Adding the left-hand side of the first equation and the left-hand side of the second equation yields \\(3x + 2y + (x - y) = 4x + y\\). Adding the right-hand sides of the two equations yields \\(10 + 1 = 11\\). Thus, \\(4x + y = 11\\).  We can rewrite the first equation as \\(x = \\frac{10 - 2y}{3}\\). Substituting this into the equation \\(4x + y = 11\\) gives \\(4(\\frac{10 - 2y}{3}) + y = 11\\). Simplifying, we have \\(\\frac{40 - 8y}{3} + y = 11\\), or \\(\\frac{40 - 8y + 3y}{3} = 11\\), or \\(\\frac{40 - 5y}{3} = 11\\).  Multiplying both sides by 3 gives \\(40 - 5y = 33\\).

Since 60 people like apples in total, we can subtract the 20 who like both apples and bananas to find that 60 - 20 = 40 people like only apples.

Another major point is that the internet has made it easier for people to access and share information from around the world, making the world a smaller and more interconnected place. The author also notes the downsides of the internet, such as the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in traditional sources of information.

For example, in one particularly moving poem, Sappho writes, \"I wish I could say to you—that I could say—that what I wish, that what I desire, that what I’m longing for, that what I’m searching for, that what is in my soul, could all come to pass. You would never leave me, never forget me.\" However, in another poem, the poet uses a less personal, more introspective tone. \"My mind is at war, and my whole body is in a fever,\" she writes, \"because I long for you, but you, you are not here.\"  The author would most likely agree that this change in tone is intended to _____.",

Writers like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens used the novel to create vivid portraits of life in England, while American authors like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville used it to explore themes of morality and the human condition.  However, the novel’s popularity was not without its critics, who argued that the genre was too sentimental and unrealistic.  Some critics even went so far as to say that the novel was nothing more than a form of escapism.  But despite the criticisms, the novel continued to thrive, and it has remained one of the most popular literary genres to this day.  Even today, writers are still using the novel to explore new ideas and to tell compelling stories.

The word was coined by science fiction writer William Gibson, who was inspired by the fact that the internet was a place where people could interact and communicate in ways that were not possible in the real world.  Gibson’s vision of cyberspace was a world of interconnected computers, data, and information, and it was a world that was constantly evolving and changing. Today, the term \"cyberspace\" is still used, but it has come to encompass a wider range of technologies and activities, including social media, mobile devices, and the internet of things.  \\n",

Capitalism is based on the principles of free enterprise, private ownership, and competition. These principles were largely absent from the preindustrial economies of Europe, where most production took place in the home or in small workshops. Because of this, capitalism's emergence in the United States led to a fundamental shift in the nation's economy and its social structure. ",

        "paragraph": "The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that a good life is one that is lived in accordance with virtue.  He argued that virtue is a matter of striking the right balance between two extremes, which he called \"excess\" and \"deficiency.\"  For example, he said that courage is the virtue that strikes a balance between the extremes of cowardice and rashness. According to Aristotle, cowardice is a deficiency of courage, while rashness is an excess of courage.  Aristotle believed that people can develop virtue by practicing virtuous behavior, which leads to the formation of good habits.  What is the best way to describe Aristotle’s argument about virtue?  What is the main point of the passage?",
        "explanation": "The passage states that courage is the virtue that strikes a balance between cowardice and rashness. This means that cowardice and rashness are opposites, and that courage lies somewhere in between.  Therefore, the best way to describe the relationship between the terms \"cowardice\" and \"rashness\" in the passage is to say that they are opposites, and that courage is a balance between them.",

        "paragraph": "In the late 19th century, the burgeoning field of scientific inquiry was profoundly shaped by the rise of Darwinism. However, the public’s reception of Darwin’s theories was not universally welcoming. In his book “The Descent of Man,” Charles Darwin, a prominent British naturalist, discussed the implications of natural selection, arguing that human beings, like other species, evolved over time. But Darwin’s work also introduced a provocative idea: humans shared a common ancestor with apes. This notion challenged long-held religious beliefs about the divine creation of humankind and sparked intense debate within the scientific community and beyond. The controversy surrounding Darwin’s theories exposed a fundamental conflict between scientific progress and traditional religious dogma, a conflict that continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about the nature of life and humanity.   ",

The pyramid was designed to show the proportions of different food groups that people should eat each day.  The pyramid was arranged with grains forming the base, followed by vegetables, fruits, and milk products, and with fats, oils, and sweets at the top.   Since then, the USDA has replaced the pyramid with a more complex \"MyPlate\" graphic.  \"MyPlate\" uses a plate to visually represent the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy.

In other words, the more meaningful the information is to someone, the more likely they are to recall it.

The original sentence is somewhat redundant, as it simply restates the idea that meaningfulness plays a role in memory. Choice A eliminates this redundancy by using a dash to introduce a brief explanation of this idea, which makes the sentence more concise and easier to understand. Choices B, C, and D are less effective because they are not as concise or clear as Choice A. Choice B uses a comma and a participial phrase, which makes the sentence more complex and less concise.

As the novel progresses, Elizabeth learns to see beyond appearances and to appreciate Mr. Darcy’s true character.

        "paragraph": "The primary reason for the current increase in the price of many goods is the growing demand for them, but the recent price hikes have also been caused by disruptions in the supply chain, particularly in manufacturing. For example, an increase in the price of gasoline has led to higher prices for a wide range of goods, since gasoline is a key input in many sectors, including transportation and manufacturing. There is a lack of consensus about whether these factors are temporary or permanent, but many economists have expressed concern about the long-term effects of price increases on consumers and businesses. Some economists have suggested that price increases, if they persist, could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and a slowdown in economic growth.",

I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",
        "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.",

The researchers found that, in general, blue-footed boobies prefer to mate with individuals that have the largest feet.  The researchers theorize that larger feet may be an indicator of health and fitness.  In order to further their research, the team wanted to determine whether the birds’ preference for large feet is a learned behavior or an instinctive one.  To this end, the researchers conducted an experiment in which some blue-footed boobies were raised in captivity and then released into the wild.   To measure the birds’ preference for large feet, the researchers observed whether the birds, when given a choice between two potential mates, would choose the mate with the larger feet.  Of the twenty birds that were raised in captivity, fourteen chose the mate with the larger feet.  This finding suggests that the blue-footed booby’s preference for large feet may be an instinctive behavior, rather than a learned one.  Although the researchers’ findings do not prove their hypothesis, the results are suggestive.  However, the researchers acknowledged that their experiment had a significant limitation.  The birds were only allowed to choose between two potential mates, so it is not possible to know for certain that the birds would choose the mate with the larger feet if given more options.  Furthermore, the researchers did not consider other factors that may have influenced the birds’ mate selection, such as the birds’ age or the availability of food.  Despite these limitations, the researchers’ findings suggest that there is a genetic component to blue-footed boobies’ preference for large feet.",

One of the author’s main arguments is that social media can be a distraction that prevents people from engaging in meaningful conversations.  For example, the author points to a study that found people who are frequently interrupted during a conversation by text messages are less likely to remember what was said. This finding suggests that social media can prevent people from being fully present in their interactions with others.  The author concludes by suggesting that people should be mindful of the potential impact of social media on their communication and make an effort to engage in more face-to-face interactions.

This struggle between opposing forces is often represented through the characters' interactions with a shadowy figure known as the Master, who is a writer who has lost his faith and is trying to find his way back to the world of literature.

This dream, he thought, would be possible if only the two sides could learn to understand each other’s values and beliefs. Jones knew that this would be a long and difficult journey, but he resolved to start with the people in his own community. He began by organizing meetings to discuss important issues that divided the two sides of the conflict, and he invited people from both sides to participate.  Jones’s efforts were met with resistance, but he remained undeterred.”",

A semicolon is used to connect closely related independent clauses.  A comma splice is when two independent clauses are connected with only a comma, which creates a grammatical error. A comma splice is also created when a comma is used incorrectly before a coordinating conjunction.  A comma followed by a coordinating conjunction can be used correctly to connect two independent clauses but not when the two clauses are not closely related.

        "paragraph": "In the early 1900s, the United States saw a surge in interest in the natural world, especially in its wild places.  A new movement arose called the ‘wilderness movement.’  This movement, which focused on the preservation of areas untouched by human development, was led by people who believed that nature had intrinsic value.  The movement was also inspired by a growing sense that the modern world was losing something essential—a connection to the natural world.  However, while the wilderness movement’s goals are still championed today, the movement’s approach to preserving wild places has become more nuanced in recent years.  The word ‘wilderness,’ which once denoted a pristine and untamed landscape, has now become more complex, and its meaning has become more contested.  Many people today argue that ‘wilderness’ is not a place that is completely free of human influence.  The concept of the ‘wilderness’ has changed, but the underlying values of the wilderness movement remain unchanged.  The word ‘wilderness’ has evolved, but the movement’s fundamental goals continue to resonate.  What is the best way to combine sentences 10 and 11?",

This trend can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the rise of privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, and the increasing pressure to maintain a perfect online image. But even those who do not use social media still benefit from the technologies that power it. For example, many people rely on GPS for navigation, which is a technology that was developed for the military. And the same technology that makes it possible to stream videos online also makes it possible to track the movement of goods across the globe.

The comma after “and” is correct because the clause “even though social media continues to evolve” is a nonessential dependent clause and thus requires a comma to separate it from the rest of the sentence. No punctuation is needed after the dependent clause because it is followed by an independent clause.  The semicolon in choice C incorrectly separates two independent clauses.  In choice D, the comma after “evolve” is incorrect because the clause is a dependent clause and doesn’t need a comma to separate it from the rest of the sentence.

As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a definite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “demands,” or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that she’s unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because  saying that Ochoa “doubts,” or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because  saying that Ochoa “establishes,” or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a definite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “demands,” or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that she’s unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because  saying that Ochoa “doubts,” or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because  saying that Ochoa “establishes,” or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

        "paragraph": "The debate over the best way to approach the study of history has been ongoing for centuries.  While some scholars believe that the most important aspect of the study of history is the exploration of the past through the examination of primary sources, others argue that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context and the impact of historical events on the present.  The following passage from a scholarly essay discusses this debate.  \n\n      \"Historians have long debated the best way to approach the study of history.  Some historians argue that the best way to understand the past is to focus on primary sources.  They argue that these sources provide an unfiltered look into the past, allowing historians to see the world through the eyes of those who lived it.  However, other historians contend that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context in which events occurred, as well as the impact of those events on the present.  To understand the past, they argue, it is necessary to see the world as a complex web of interconnected events that have shaped the present.   In other words, they suggest, it is important to avoid viewing history as a series of isolated facts.   \n\n        In this way, the two approaches can be seen as two sides of the same coin.  Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.  Historians who focus on primary sources are more likely to produce accounts that are grounded in the evidence.  However, their accounts may also be more limited in scope, failing to address the complexities of the historical context.   \n\n        Historians who take a more holistic approach are more likely to produce accounts that are broader in scope and more nuanced in their understanding of the past.    However, their accounts may also be more prone to bias and interpretation.   \n\n        Ultimately, the best way to approach the study of history is to find a balance between these two approaches.\"  \n\n       What is the most likely reason that the author of this passage refers to the two approaches as “two sides of the same coin”?

        "explanation": "The author uses the analogy of \"two sides of the same coin\" to indicate that while the two approaches to history are different, they work together to create a more complete understanding of the past.  This suggests that the two approaches are complementary.",

Moore gives the example of a poem about \"a single person, the individual.\" Although such a poem might be about a single person, it can take many different forms, such as a sonnet, a free verse poem, a narrative poem, or a dramatic monologue.

The rise of electronic music in the twentieth century, with its reliance on synthesizers and computers, furthered the trend toward a more artificial sound. This technological trend has reached its apotheosis in the present day, with the proliferation of digital music streaming services that have rendered the traditional model of music consumption obsolete. The digital revolution, while it has democratized access to music and made it easier than ever to create and share it, has also created a culture of disposable music, in which songs are consumed quickly and then discarded, and the art of music making is increasingly marginalized.\" ",

        "explanation": "The original sentence contains a comma splice, which is a grammatical error that occurs when two independent clauses are joined together by a comma without a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon. To correct this error, we need to either add a coordinating conjunction after the comma (e.g., \"The study…Berkeley, found that…and, the researchers…\") or replace the comma with a semicolon (e.g., \"The study…Berkeley, found that…; the researchers…\"). Of the given choices, only choice A corrects the comma splice by adding the conjunction \"found\" after the comma.

The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night.\nThe baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",
        "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.",

The growing prevalence of emojis and other visual symbols in online communication has led some to question whether they are eroding the standards of traditional written communication.  However, there is evidence that emojis can enhance the clarity and conciseness of online communication, making it more efficient. Some language experts argue that the use of emojis is not only natural, it’s inevitable, as the evolution of language itself has always involved the adoption of new symbols.",

The comma effectively signals that the second sentence is a continuation of the first sentence, and it doesn't interrupt the flow of the sentence. Choice A is incorrect because it uses a comma and a conjunction to separate the two sentences, which is unnecessary because they are independent clauses. Choice C is incorrect because it uses a semicolon, which is typically used to separate independent clauses that are not closely related in meaning.

The ancient Egyptians, for their part, believed in a system of gods and goddesses, and some scholars argue that the pyramid was built as a tomb for a powerful pharaoh. The theory of alien intervention, on the other hand, relies on the idea that the pyramid could not have been built with the technology that was available to the ancient Egyptians.

The eggs are laid on the leaves of plants, and the larvae hatch from the eggs and feed on the leaves. The larvae grow larger and larger and eventually pupate, forming a chrysalis. The pupa is a resting stage in which the butterfly undergoes metamorphosis.  The adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. The text highlights the importance of the butterfly’s relationship with plants, describing the role of plants in providing food and shelter for the larvae, and the role of plants in the butterfly’s metamorphosis.  It also discusses the butterfly’s relationship with other species, including the butterflies’ predators and the butterflies’ symbiotic relationship with ants.

Choice C uses a semicolon to separate two independent clauses, which is not the preferred way to combine these two thoughts.

The concept of the arrow of time seems self-evident, and yet it raises a fundamental question about the nature of reality.  If time is truly unidirectional, then does this imply that the past is somehow gone, vanished, or inaccessible, or that the future does not yet exist?  The idea of the arrow of time challenges our understanding of the universe and our place in it.  If the past is gone, what does that mean for our memories and our sense of identity?  And if the future does not yet exist, how can we plan for it or hope to change it?  These questions have no easy answers, but they are crucial to our understanding of our place in the universe.",

There are many more colors than humans can see, but we can only perceive those colors that fall within the range of our visual spectrum.

For example, the study of behavioral economics has shown that people may be more influenced by social factors, such as emotions and personal experiences, than by rational considerations.

The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",

Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect.

The researchers suggest that when people procrastinate, they are not simply avoiding work but are instead allowing their minds to wander and explore new possibilities.
